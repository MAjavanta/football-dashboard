Recommended Cleanup & Best Practice Implementation Path
1. Organize and Refactor File Structure
Why first?
A clean, logical file structure sets the foundation for everything else — tests, modular code, and future features.

Actions:

Create separate folders/modules for:
api/ — API interaction code (e.g., fetch.py containing your get_competitions and get_matches functions).
models/ — Pydantic models.
db/ — Placeholder for future database-related code.
tests/ — All test code.
utils/ or common/ — Helper functions, logging setup, config loaders.
Move your current code into these modules accordingly.
Add an entry point script, e.g., main.py, that orchestrates calls.
Example structure:

football_dashboard/
│
├── api/
│   └── fetch.py
│
├── models/
│   └── schemas.py
│
├── db/
│   └── __init__.py  # empty for now
│
├── tests/
│   ├── test_fetch.py
│   └── test_models.py
│
├── utils/
│   └── logging.py
│
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── .env
2. Parameterize Functions & Remove Globals
Why second?
Parameterization improves modularity and testability, which you’ll need for writing meaningful tests next.

Actions:

Refactor your functions to accept parameters rather than relying on global variables.
Make functions return data instead of modifying global lists.
Add default values as appropriate but allow overrides.
3. Add Logging and Error Handling
Why third?
Logging and error handling improve observability and robustness, helping you debug and maintain your code.

Actions:

Set up a centralized logging configuration (e.g., in utils/logging.py).
Replace print() statements with logging calls (logger.info(), logger.error(), etc.).
Add try/except blocks around API calls and critical operations.
Use response.raise_for_status() to catch HTTP errors.
Log exceptions with stack traces.
4. Write Docstrings and Documentation
Why fourth?
Clear docstrings improve code readability and serve as documentation for yourself and others.

Actions:

Add docstrings to all functions and classes following PEP 257 conventions.
Include descriptions of parameters, return values, and exceptions.
Optionally, add a README or usage guide if not already present.
5. Write Unit Tests
Why fifth?
Tests verify your code correctness and prevent regressions. Writing tests after parameterization and refactoring ensures your code is testable.

Actions:

Use a testing framework like pytest.
Write tests for:
API fetching functions (mock API responses).
Data validation with Pydantic models.
Utility functions.
Test error handling paths (e.g., simulate API failures).
Run tests frequently during refactor to catch issues early.
6. Set Up Environment and Configuration Management
Why sixth?
Centralized config management makes your project flexible and secure.

Actions:

Use .env files with python-dotenv (already done).
Create a config module to load and expose environment variables and constants.
Parameterize API keys, URLs, and other constants.
7. Prepare for Database Integration
Why last before actual DB code?
Once your code is clean, tested, and robust, adding a database layer becomes easier and safer.

Actions:

Define your database schema based on models.
Implement database connection and CRUD operations in the db/ module.
Write integration tests for DB operations.
Integrate DB calls into your data ingestion pipeline.
